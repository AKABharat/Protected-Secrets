# Protected-Secrets

This repository contains a simple web application called "Secrets" that demonstrates a basic password-protected page using HTML, JavaScript, and Express.js.

## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create a password-protected web page where users can access secret information only if they enter the correct password. The project demonstrates how to use Express.js to handle HTTP requests and how to implement a basic password authentication system.

## Learning Goals

By exploring this project, you can learn the following concepts:

1. Building a basic web application with HTML, Node.JS ,its framework Express.JS and npm package. 
2. Using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, to handle HTTP requests and responses.
3. Implementing password authentication and authorization to control access to specific content on a webpage.

## How to Use the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: npm install
5. Start the application by running: npm start
6. The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
7. Access the "Secrets" web page by opening your web browser and entering the URL mentioned above.
8. You will be prompted to enter a password. The correct password to access the secret information is **ILoveProgramming** (case-sensitive).
9. If you enter the correct password, you will be redirected to a page displaying some intriguing secrets ðŸ¤«.
10. If you enter the wrong password or leave it blank, you will be redirected back to the login page.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications to experiment with different functionalities or to enhance the project further.

## Note

This project is for educational and demonstrational purposes only. In a real-world scenario, it's essential to implement robust security measures when handling sensitive information or user authentication. For production applications, consider using more secure authentication methods and tools to protect user data.
